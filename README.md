# Data Playground
set up of data server with various analysis programs

Tutorial to provide information regarding setup of various tools for running data science workbench.  I am a research immunologist but really enjoy munging and working with data in a computational format.  Excel and Prism are amazing programs but I really wanted to delve into more of the command line formats for data analysis

# What I Work With
1. R Studio Server
  * packages that i like to work with - links to non linear analysis
2. Julia and IJulia
  * speedy R like stats
3. Data Science at the command line
  * without the vagrant

#Python Implementations - what i am starting to work with
1. Anaconda
  * Free bundled python libraries for data analysis
  * saves alot of time getting all of the packages
2. IPython Notebook Server
3. Rodeo Server from yhat
  * I really like this one because of how clean and easy it is.
