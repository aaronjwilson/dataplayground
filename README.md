# Data Playground
set up of data server with various analysis programs

Tutorial to provide information regarding setup of various tools for running data science workbench.  I am a research immunologist but really enjoy munging and working with data in a computational format.  Excel and Prism are amazing programs but I really wanted to delve into more of the command line formats for data analysis

# What I Work With
1. [R Studio Server](./rStudio.md)
  * packages that i like to work with - links to non linear analysis
2. [Labkey Server Implementation](./labkey.md)
2. Julia and IJulia
  * speedy R like stats
3. Data Science at the command line
  * without the vagrant
4. [Project Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterhub "JUPYTER")
  * language agnosticism is brilliant.  would love to see implemented in a Rodeo gui.

# R Studio Server

Hadley Wickham is the Steve Jobs of R implementations.  Anything package he has made is clean, thoughful, and beautifully executed. Not the least saying that it is accessible especially for a language like R. 

# Labkey Server Setup

[Labkey](https://www.labkey.com "LABKEY") is a very powerful open source web application server used primarily for collaborating on scientific studies.  It is a great format for aggregating, integrating, analyzing and ultimating reporting scientific data.  If there is clear adoption in a collaborative environment it excells at promoting group interaction.

This was for me a very intense learning gateway.  It was thoroughly enjoyable to learn to setup on a linux machine and Amazon Web Services.  There is an executable for Windows for those who just want to start straight away.  There is also an Amazon Web Services image (based on Centoos - I believe) which is also a great way to get started.   

#Python Implementations - what i am starting to work with
1. Anaconda
  * Free bundled python libraries for data analysis
  * saves alot of time getting all of the packages
2. IPython Notebook Server
3. Rodeo Server from yhat
  * I am really enjoying this one because of how clean and easy it is.
