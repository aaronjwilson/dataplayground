# Data Playground
set up of data server with various analysis programs

Tutorial to provide information regarding setup of various tools for running data science workbench.  I am a research immunologist but really enjoy munging and working with data in a computational format.  Excel and Prism are amazing programs but I really wanted to delve into more of the command line formats for data analysis

# What I Work With
1. R Studio Server
  * packages that i like to work with - links to non linear analysis
2. Julia and IJulia
  * speedy R like stats
3. Data Science at the command line
  * without the vagrant
4. Project Jupyter
  * I appreciate this project and what it is trying to do with agnosticism.

#Python Implementations - what i am starting to work with
1. Anaconda
  * Free bundled python libraries for data analysis
  * saves alot of time getting all of the packages
2. IPython Notebook Server
3. Rodeo Server from yhat
  * I really like this one because of how clean and easy it is.

# Labkey Server Setup

[Labkey](https://www.labkey.com "LABKEY") is a very powerful open source web application server used primarily for collaborating on scientific studies.  It is a great format for aggregating, integrating, analyzing and ultimating reporting scientific data.  If there is clear adoption it excells at promoting group interaction. This was thoroughly enjoyable to learn to setup on a linux machine and Amazon Web Services.  There is an executable for Windows for those who just want to start straight away.  There is also an Amazon Web Services image (based on Centoos - I believe) which is also a great way to get started.
